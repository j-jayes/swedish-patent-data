## Purpose

I want to collect the Swedish patents that mention electricity, download the pdfs, convert them to machine readable text and do some NLP on them. 

The bigger project will look at to what extent the patents introduce labour augmenting technology vs labour replacing technology.

## Process

I've made a scraper to get the patent information and PDFs. Currently I'm being blocked by the server because it is clear I am a bot. I've emailed the provider of the patents and await their response.

In the meantime I've begun to work on the pipeline to extract the text from the patents and then translate them into english.
