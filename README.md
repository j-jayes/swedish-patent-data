## Purpose

I want to collect the Swedish patents that mention electricity, download the pdfs, convert them to machine readable text and do some NLP on them. 

The bigger project will look at to what extent the patents introduce labour augmenting technology vs labour replacing technology.

## Process

I have scraped Google Patents for 10,000 patents that were registered in Sweden. I am now working to analyse these.

From the [PRV](https://data.prv.se/) I will access the XML data on applications from 1973-2017. For patents prior to this, I have to download the PDFs manually it seems. My scraper is being blocked.
