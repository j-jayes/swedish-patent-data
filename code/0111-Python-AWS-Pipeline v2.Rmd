```{r}
library(reticulate)
library(here)
```

```{python}
# !pip install boto3[crt]
import boto3
```

First I have to configure the AWS client with my credentials. To do this I need to install the [AWS shell](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-shell)?


```{python}
# !pip install aws-shell

# initialize the textract client
client = boto3.client('textract', region_name = 'us-east-2')
```

Following [This tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/examples-export-table-csv.html)

So we have created the python file - now we must use the terminal to get the file to process.

```{r}
path = "Egentliga Finland_11_16_3_255_gray_dither_cropped_tight.jpg"
```
